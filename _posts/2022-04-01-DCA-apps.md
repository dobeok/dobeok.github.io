## Introduction

Dollar cost averaging (DCA) is investing a fixed amount of money into a particular investment at regular intervals, typically monthly or quarterly.

* This strategy is simple to understand, but retail investors often find it hard to excute due to them being susceptible to emotional investing.

* 2 most common mistakes are FOMO - overbuy then market rallies, or staying out completely when market dips and waiting for market to recover.

    * when market tops, the same dollar amount could buy fewer underlying assets
    * in contrast, it is virtually impossible to time the market bottom. So by staying out during downturns, investors miss out on the chance to buy cheaply

Hence, DCA is often a good strategy for the unsophisicated investors.

## The apps

I've created a Streamlit apps to backtest strategies.
