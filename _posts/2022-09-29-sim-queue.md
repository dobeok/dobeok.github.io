## Introduction

In this post I will use [simpy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to simulate a queueing line at the airport check in counters. This is an example of Discret-event simulation (DES). In contrast to Monte-Carlo simulation, DES are useful when you need to keep track of a system's state and analyze resource usage over time.

There are many practial use cases where you might need DES. In particular, for a queue system, we want to balance out cost (as reflected by number of counters) vs. customer experience (as measured by wait time)

## Assumptions & Methodology

![queue diagram](/assets/images/posts/simulate-queue/queue diagram.png)

- There are 8 counters available for check-in. When passengers arrive that the airport terminal, they will join a shared queue and go up to the next available counter.
- Check-in time follows a normal distribution with a mean of 2 minutes and standard deviation of 1 minute. To spice things up, I've also added a 5% chance that a passenger might have issues with their paperwork and can take up to 10 minutes to resolve.
- Before the counter opens, a group of 30 passengers arrived at the airport. (They just want to have more buffer time and enjoy walking around the airport)
- In the first 30 minutes, passengers arrive at a slower rate. Afterwards, the arrival rate increases.


The above assumptions are coded as following:
```python3
NUM_COUNTERS = 8

CHECK_DURATION_AVG = 2
CHECK_DURATION_STD = 1

PASSENGER_INTERVAL_1ST = 1 # on average, 1 customer arrived every minute
PASSENGER_INTERVAL_2ND = .33 # on average, 3 customers arrived every minute

INITIAL_NUM_PASSENGERS = 30
MAX_PASSENGERS = 250
```
Note: In simpy, time units can be arbitrary depending on the problem you are modeling. For the sake of clarify, I will use minutes to measure time in this model.


The full code can be found at the end of the post. Here I'd like to highlight a few key details:


### Modeling the check in process

```python3
def check_in(self, passenger):

    p = np.random.uniform(low=0.0, high=1.0)

    # normal passengers
    if p < .95:
        random_time = max(1, np.random.normal(self.check_duration, self.check_std))
    
    # 5% of passengers have problems and need more time
    else:
        random_time = max(10, np.random.normal(self.check_duration, self.check_std))

    print(f'Start checking in passenger {passenger} at {self.env.now:1f}')
    yield self.env.timeout(random_time)
    print(f'Finish checking in passenger {passenger} at {self.env.now:1f}')
```

Here we're doing 2 things:


```python3
p = np.random.uniform(low=0.0, high=1.0)
if p < .95:
    ...
```

We get a random number, if the value is < .95, then the passenger's check in time follows the distribution with CHECK_DURATION_AVG and CHECK_DURATION_STD.
For the remaining 5% of the cases, the staff will need 10 minutes to complete.


```python3
print(f'Start checking in passenger {passenger} at {self.env.now:1f}')
yield self.env.timeout(random_time)
print(f'Finish checking in passenger {passenger} at {self.env.now:1f}')
```
This is the actual check-in event. The 2 printing functions are optional, but helpful to collect the output to analyze the system. The env.timeout() method simulates check-in duration.

### Modeling passengers behavior

```python3
def passenger(env, pid, ch_in):
    """
    pid = unique identifier for passenger
    """
    print(f'Passenger {pid} arrived at the airport and join the queue at {env.now:.1f}')

    # join queue and wait for the next available counter
    with ch_in.staff.request() as request:
        yield request
        yield env.process(ch_in.check_in(pid))
```

This is the passenger process. Each passenger is assigned a unique id (`pid`) for ease of tracking.

```python3
with ch_in.staff.request() as request:
    yield request
    yield env.process(ch_in.check_in(pid))
```
This part simulates the passenger joining the queue, and will be served when they're at the front of the queue and there's an available counter.


### Setting up the simulation

```python3
def setup(env, initial_passengers, passenger_interval_1st, passenger_interval_2nd, max_passengers):
    # initialize first of group passengers who arrived before counter open
    for i in range(initial_passengers):
        env.process(passenger(env, i, ch_in))
    

    # simulate passengers coming in with normal interarrival time
    while i <= max_passengers:
        # first hour
        if env.now < 30:
            t = np.random.exponential(passenger_interval_1st)

        else:
            t = np.random.exponential(passenger_interval_2nd)
        
        yield env.timeout(t)
        
        i += 1
        env.process(passenger(env, i, ch_in))
```

Normally, we don't run the simulation just once and take the first result! But instead we will repeat it for ten or hundred of thousand times and perhaps changing the assumptions/parameters. Hence it's convenient to write a setup function to initialize the simulation.


The rest of the codes are standard python functions. You can add additional logging features to help debug or customize queue logic.

## Results & Observations

### Passengers arrival

    <em>Fig 1 (top), Fig 2 (bottom)</em>
</p>


Figures 1 and 2 shows details for individual passengers.
- Figure 1 shows the cumulative number of passengers arriving against time
    - At time 0, we had 30 passengers before the counters opended. The line starts at point (0, 30).
    - The slope is flatter before the 30 minutes mark, and got stepper afterwards. This is because we assumed higher arrival rate.
- Figure 2 shows the time each passenger spent in the queue system: from arriving at the terminal until they finished checking in
    - Each passenger is one horizontal line. The blue dots indicate start time, orange dots indicate end time.
    - The length of the line is proportional to the time taken.
    - The longer lines that stand out incidate passengers with issues and held their counter up for 10 minutes ;(

- Additional details for wait time


|   |   service_time |
|:-----:|:--------------:|
| count |      250       |
| mean  |        2.55555 |
| std   |        2.00238 |
| min   |        1       |
| 25%   |        1.4025  |
| 50%   |        2.07835 |
| 75%   |        2.91865 |
| max   |       10       |

### Queue and Utilization


<p align="center">
  <img alt="fig2" src="/assets/images/posts/simulate-queue/fig2-212454.png">
    <em>Fig 3 (top), Fig 4 (bottom)</em>
</p>


Figure 3 and 4 monitor queue length and resource utilizations.
- In Figure 3, we can see the queue line is the longest at the beginning
    - This is due to the group of early passengers. Therefore, if you don't want to wait in line, it's probably best to avoid arriving too early!
    - The queue starts to build up again as passengers arrived at an increased rate after 30 mins.

- Finally we are also interested in resource utilizations. This is where the trade-off comes in.
    - Utilization at any time is measured as the number of busy counter / total number of counters
    - We can estimate overall utilization by measuring area under the curve. In this case it's equal to roughly 81%
    - As a business owner, we wouldn't want our resources to stay idle for too long. Perhaps we might try to reduce the number of counter by 1 and re-run the simulation. However, it's important to note that for an airport, all passengers need to be checked-in before flight time. Hence maximum utilization might not be the highest priority.

## Takeaway

* This is only a toy sample with somewhat simple assumptions. We can observe real data and model the different processes (arrival time, check-in time, etc) more accurately. However, even with such simple assumptions, we can see that DES is an useful tool for analyzing systems and finding bottlenecks.
* For our airport queue model, we only take number of counters as cost. However, in another business scenario (such as a restaurant queue), costs might also include lost income from reneged customer (who might wait too long).
* Simpy is flexible and not just limited to modelling queueing. Other use cases might be allocating production capacity at a manufacturing plant, or perhaps scheduling transportation trucks between warehouses. All these real life scenarios inherently contains a lot of random variations and would benefit from DES.
